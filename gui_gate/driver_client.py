"""A bounded MCP stdio client for prepared Cua Driver targets.

Derived from Octet's MIT-licensed client. Explicit transport argv can use a
reviewed SSH proxy; the operator owns target provisioning and desktop consent.

This speaks the subset of the Model Context Protocol the driver actually uses:
``initialize``, ``notifications/initialized``, ``tools/list``, and
``tools/call``. It is intentionally not a general MCP implementation. The
driver is a prepared, single-owner server, and the harness owns session
lifetime, cancellation, workflow authorization, and retained evidence.

Safety properties:

* The direct client path uses ``mcp --direct``; when ``app_daemon`` is selected,
  it connects to the explicitly configured desktop-host socket. It never grants
  an operating-system permission on its own.
* Only reviewed, non-secret desktop session variables are forwarded. Provider
  tokens and arbitrary ambient environment are never inherited.
* Every response is size-bounded, and a tool that does not declare an exact
  ``readOnlyHint: true`` is classified as effectful so the caller can gate it.
